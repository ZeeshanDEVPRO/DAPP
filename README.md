This is a full stack Voting DAPP, made by using modern-day technologies like ethereum,solidity,React.js and ether.js.Here you can perform the following operations, all with blockchain as your backend:

The creator can create an election, he is the one who can add candidates and add metamask address of the voters.
Only the registered accounts will be allowed to vote or see the results.
Voting is only allowed between the start time and the end time.
No voter or candidate can be added after the election starts.
The result will be available only after the voting ends.
All transactions will be handled through metamask.
Only the creator is authorised to cancel the election.
Election can not be cancelled between start and end time.
A user can create multiple elections but is authorised to vote only in the election in which he is a voter.
Remember, all transaction needs SEPOLIA ETH, which can be obtained from the Ethereum sepolia faucet.
